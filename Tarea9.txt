Classes Part I: Syntax and Memory

1) Implement linked_list as class LinkedList, developing the function for printing as in the example for Fraction.

2) Adapt linked_list insert, remove and free.

3) Adapt linked_list tests, and check that there is no leak with valgrind (no more than 72,704 reachable bytes at exit).
